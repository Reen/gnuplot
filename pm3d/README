Subj: pm3d: new splot mode for gray/colour maps and surfaces

Here a new type of splot mode:  pm3d.  This adds the possibility to draw 
colour/gray maps and surfaces (even without preprocessing!) in addition to 
contours and wired surfaces currently supported. Please look at some 
snapshots of the new functionality at
	- http://www.sci.muni.cz/~mikulik/gnuplot.html
	- http://www.zellner.org/gnuplot

Current (development) gnuplot-mouse-pm3d sources are available from
        - anonymous cvs (the preferred method) at:
	  :pserver:anonymous@krispc7.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de:/cvs/pub
	  (there's no password)
	  module: gnuplot
	  branch: pm3d
	- http://www.zellner.org/gnuplot

pm3d mode works on terminals capable of filled colour polygons. Currently 
supported terminals are:
	OS/2 Presentation Manager
	X11
	Linux VGA
	PostScript
	GIF
	Xfig

You are welcome to run pm3d demo. Please use "help set pm3d" for further 
information.

Subdirectories:
	demo: demo for pm3d
	contrib: contributions using pm3d (colour points, compress pm3d 
		 postscript file,...)
	old-docs: technical docs from the first public release of pm3d 
		 in January 1999


Compilation:

        - OS/2: uncomment line with  PM3D=1  in Makefile/os2
        - Unix: ./configure --enable-pm3d --enable-mouse
          (if you want several gnuplot_x11 drivers to coexist on your
           system you can additionally choose something like
           --with-X11-driver=gnuplot_x11_March3)
        then make

You may download precompiled OS/2 binaries from
